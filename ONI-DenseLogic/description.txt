[h1]Automation Expanded[/h1]

[b]Banhi's Automation Innovation Pack[/b] brought us incredible new 4-Bit [b]Automation[/b] wires to [b]Oxygen Not Included[/b] but [b]Klei[/b] left us without many tools for using these new wires.
This [b]Automation Expansion Pack[/b] introduces a variety of new [b]Automation[/b] buildings to work with the 4-Bit wires. All new buildings come with custom art and user interfaces deisgned to match the base game [b]Automation[/b] look.

[h1]New Buildings ([b]Automation Ribbon[/b])[/h1]

[list]
[*] [b]Signal Multiswitch[/b]: a 4-Bit analogue of the [b]Signal Switch[/b]. Sends a signal to every bit of an [b]Automation Ribbon[/b]. Configurable with simple UI upon clicking the building. Settings copyable to other [b]Signal Multiswitches[/b].
[*] [b]Ribbon Rearranger[/b]: rearranges the order of the signals transmitted by an [b]Automation Ribbon[/b], e.g. swaps the value of bit 1 with bit 3. Configurable with simple UI upon clicking the building. Settings copyable to other [b]Ribbon Rearrangers[/b].
[*] [b]Dense Multigate[/b]: configurable logic gate for [b]Automation Ribbon[/b] inputs and output. Logic gate type is switchable (between AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR) using simple UI upon clicking the building. Logic gate type is copyable to other [b]Dense Multigate[/b].
[*] [b]Inline Logic Gate[/b]: an incredibly small logic gate only 1 tile in size. Uses a single connection to an [b]Automation Ribbon[/b] for both its inputs and output, e.g. computes the AND of bit 1 and bit 4 and outputs to bit 2. Logic gate type and inputs/output bits configurable with simple UI upon clicking the building. Settings copyable to other [b]Inline Logic Gates[/b].
[*] [b]Dense (De)Multiplexer[/b]: smaller variants on the [b]Signal Selector[/b] and [b]Signal Distributor[/b]. Only 2x2 tiles in size by taking input/output as an [b]Automation Ribbon[/b].
[*] [b]Seven Segment Display[/b]: displays the value of an [b]Automation Ribbon[/b] treated as a binary number. Shows digits 0 through 9. Has an overflow output if input digit is between 10 through 15.

[h1]New Buildings ([b]Automation Wire[/b])[/h1]

[list]
[*] [b]Data Latch[/b]: like the [b]Memory Toggle[/b] but instead of functioning as a SR-latch, functions as a D-latch with a data line and set line. Works with [b]Automation Ribbons[/b] for the data and output lines too.
[*] [b]NAND,NOR,XNOR Gate[/b]: three separate buildings. Functions exactly like the AND,OR,XOR Gates provided in the vanilla game but inverts the output.
[*] [b]Rising Edge Detector[/b]: when it detects a rising edge (the input transitions from low to high), provides a green output for a configurable number of seconds. Settings copyable to other [b]Rising Edge Detectors[/b].
[*] [b]Falling Edge Detector[/b]: when it detects a falling edge (the input transitions from high to low), provides a green output for a configurable number of second. Settings copyable to other [b]Falling Edge Detectors[/b].

[h1]Problems/Help[/h1]

If there are problems with the mod please reach out on the (un)official Oxygen Not Included Discord where we hang around on the modding channels as @test447, @peterhaneve, and @Hexicube. 
We probably won't pay full attention to steam comments.
