[b]Banhi's Automation Innovation Pack[/b] brought us incredible new 4-Bit [b]Automation[/b] wires to [b]Oxygen Not Included[/b] but [b]Klei[/b] left us without many tools for using these new wires.
This [b]Automation Expansion Pack[/b] introduces a variety of new [b]Automation[/b] buildings to work with the 4-Bit wires. All new buildings come with custom art and user interfaces designed to match the base game [b]Automation[/b] look.

[h1]Signal Multiswitch[/h1]

A 4-Bit analogue of the [b]Signal Switch[/b]. Sends a signal to every bit of an [b]Automation Ribbon[/b].

Configurable with simple UI upon clicking the building. Settings copyable to other [b]Signal Multiswitches[/b].

[h1]Inline Logic Gate[/h1]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/2m8HuAB.png[/img]

An incredibly small logic gate only 1 tile in size. Uses a single connection to an [b]Automation Ribbon[/b] for both its inputs and output, e.g. computes the AND of bit 1 and bit 4 and outputs to bit 2.

Logic gate type and inputs/output bits configurable with simple UI upon clicking the building. Settings copyable to other [b]Inline Logic Gates[/b].

[h1]Seven Segment Display[/h1]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/9H2V2h6.png[/img]

Displays the value of an [b]Automation Ribbon[/b] treated as a binary number. Shows digits 0 through 9.

Has an overflow output if input digit is between 10 through 15.

[h1]NAND/NOR/XNOR Gate[/h1]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/Mb2amfC.png[/img]

Functions exactly like the AND/OR/XOR gates provided in the vanilla game, but inverts the output.

[h1]Dense (De)Multiplexer[/h1]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/Tpw0IVo.png[/img]

Smaller variants on the [b]Signal Selector[/b] and [b]Signal Distributor[/b].

Only 2x2 tiles in size by using the [b]Automation Ribbon[/b] as an input/output.

[h1]Dense Multigate[/h1]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/CbfjZmR.png[/img]

Configurable logic gate for [b]Automation Ribbon[/b] inputs and output.

Logic gate type is switchable between AND/OR/XOR/NAND/NOR/XNOR using a simple UI upon clicking the building. Logic gate type is copyable to other [b]Dense Multigate[/b].

[h1]Ribbon Rearranger[/h1]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/XEzgpsI.png[/img]

Rearranges the order of the signals transmitted by an [b]Automation Ribbon[/b], e.g. swaps the value of bit 1 with bit 3.

Configurable with simple UI upon clicking the building. Settings copyable to other [b]Ribbon Rearrangers[/b].

[h1]Data Latch[/h1]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/1n6W8gs.png[/img]

Like the [b]Memory Toggle[/b] but instead of functioning as a SR-latch, functions as a D-latch with a data line and set line.

Works with [b]Automation Ribbons[/b] for the data and output lines too.

[h1]Problems/Help[/h1]
If there are problems with the mod please reach out on the (un)official Oxygen Not Included Discord where we hang around on the modding channels as @test447, @peterhaneve, and @Hexicube. 
We probably won't pay full attention to steam comments.
